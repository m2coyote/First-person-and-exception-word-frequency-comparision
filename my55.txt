Yet in the United States - which does *not* have plain packaging - the rate dropped from 19.3 (in 2010) to 17.8 (in 2013). That's 1.5 percent (19.3 - 17.8).

Learning how to sacrifice a piece can translate into learning how to lose a battle to win a war. Or how to distract your opponent with a juicy tidbit only to go after your real prize.

I love chess and when I started training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo the comparison was immedietky recognizable. Feign weakness present a target to distract, don't push back against resistance, but use it to your advantage encouraging your opponent to overextend or overcommit.

This has much more far reaching applicability beyond chess or war or even competitive sports or combat sports. It holds up in politics and heirarchal relationships of every kind.

It holds water in a negotiation or an argument, for example. Or when asking for a raise.

The applicability of chess is to understand the concept, philosophy, and psychology behind it and the benefits are far reaching.

Similarly you can take disciplines in the arts and compare them to other situations.

How often did war lords during China's warring states period study the discipline and gentleness of the calligrapher just to have an epiphany about a certain strategy and so on. Gentle strokes, don't press too hard...etc.

Will playing chess make you a better guitar player? No, but understanding the structure and composition  of a universally pleasant melody and the methodology of a chess match are interchangeable and useful as a life philaophy applicable to every conceivable aspect of existence.

4. To prevent further mutation or expansion of some variant resistant to this new immunotherapy, some form of HAART (which then could also be lessened) could still be employed thereby hitting the virus with two-different forms of treatment: cellular + small-molecule.

Abstract

Aging and chronic disease development are multifactorial processes involving the cumulative effects of metabolic distress, inflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics. Recently, variations in the gut microbiota have been associated with age-related phenotypes and probiotics have shown promise in managing chronic disease progression. In this study, novel probiotic and synbiotic formulations are shown to combinatorially extend longevity in male Drosophila melanogaster through mechanisms of gut-brain-axis communication with implications in chronic disease management. Both the probiotic and synbiotic formulations rescued markers of metabolic stress by managing insulin resistance and energy regulatory pathways. Both formulations also ameliorated elevations in inflammation, oxidative stress and the loss of mitochondrial complex integrity. In almost all the measured pathways, the synbiotic formulation has a more robust impact than its individual components insinuating its combinatorial effect. The concomitant action of the gut microbiota on each of the key risk factors of aging and makes it a powerful therapeutic tool against neurodegeneration, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and other age-related chronic diseases.

I'm not saying there's no connection between exposure and outcome they measured, but scientifically, but it would be irresponsible to say that the connection is infallible and robust (and certainly not universal, which the authors acknowledge).
In addition, to the title of this post, the fact that glyphosate exists in urine is almost meaningless. Our bodies are pretty good at getting rid of glyphosate through urine. The important question is does urinary glyphosate content correlate with a health outcome, which this study does not prove. But it definitely needs to be studied further.",0

Itsy Bitsy Spider.: Infants React with Increased Arousal to Spiders and Snakes.

Abstract:

&gt; Attention biases have been reported for ancestral threats like spiders and snakes in infants, children, and adults. However, it is currently unclear whether these stimuli induce increased physiological arousal in infants. Here, 6-month-old infants were presented with pictures of spiders and flowers (Study 1, within-subjects), or snakes and fish (Study 1, within-subjects; Study 2, between-subjects). Infants' pupillary responses linked to activation of the noradrenergic system were measured. Infants reacted with increased pupillary dilation indicating arousal to spiders and snakes compared with flowers and fish. Results support the notion of an evolved preparedness for developing fear of these ancestral threats.

"12967",13153,"&gt;most of the men were already in rough shape when they headed into their final battle. Sixteen had experienced previous head injuries; one man had even suffered four head wounds in previous conflicts before he died. Twenty-one had other healed or healing bone injuries, like fractures in the arms, legs and ribs.

Just imagining the culture these men had with one another, in comparison to modern armies. Like in the US marines (who consider themselves the most fearsome fighting force in the world) typically if you're shot, you're removed from the battlefield and are given time to heal. These men didn't take any time off to heal. It makes me wonder if they truly believed in their religious cause so strongly that they were able to use that faith to suppress the pain of their injuries, with the belief that they would feel no pain in the afterlife. Or maybe they would just condescend one another so strongly if one complained, that to save face they'd ignore the pain and carry on. 

Whatever the motivation, these men were tougher than probably 99% of people out there today. They probably were pretty rough with the townspeople as well, which could explain the disdain mentioned at the end of the article.

Edit: I mean no disrespect to the us marines. They fight for something they believe in even with a country that is often not behind them, and they offer their lives for the cause and what they feel is right. I'm sure if asked to, many marines would fight injured and never give up. These men proved it, though, and evidence shows they went back for more multiple times.

Edit 2: I may have made some assumptions that are incorrect here. I still think these soldiers were hard as fuck, but possibly they were forced to be by their commanders, or had no choice due to monetary reasons, or simply didn't know better. The brutality of the environment they fought in still created some pretty tough sounding individuals.",0

2-what is the pressure that the water is sent through the SENT filter?  edit: no real indication of this, only that it will do 5L/m.  
3-what is the cost?  edit: $.25 a gram.  
4-does the water need to be ""pre-filtered"" with something like a Poly filter?  edit: yes. It's quartz wool, so you'd need very clean water.   
   
Answered my own questions... HOWEVER.  
  
I keep seeing a lot of ""low cost"" and ""Easily repeatable at any skill level""... If i recall reading right, you need to create this stuff at 800c, and most people i know in America don't have a furnace that can do this - nor do they have access to ferrocene; toluene, sure. So... not sure this is easily recreateable. Also, you always see things online about how people in 3rd world countries live on less than $1 per day, so i'm not sure this would be cheap for people like this...   
  
And the thing that has me hung up is this statement:  
Time trials indicated that a scaled-up version of the filter (200x) could filter 5 L of water in 1 minute and be renewed in just 1.5 min; moreover, the 12-trial lead saturation analysis indicated that the filter could maintain a filtration capacity greater than 99.9% for up to 70 L/100 g of SENTs filter medium, before it needs to be renewed.  
  
So for every 70L of water, you need to regen for 1.5min at what rate? That could be a shitload of vinegar, and a big waste of food to generate that vinegar. To me, that's 5 or 6L of vinegar to regen...

"8423",8540,"I live in Belarus and the process of transitioning, specifically the part where you get your gender in all IDs changed (which is then followed by all the necessary medicinal and surgical treatment [which is free btw]) seems very confirmatory here. Don't know if it's the same in other countries, but I guess it might be at least somewhat similar.  
    
By ""confirmatory"" I mean that if a person decides that they are transgender they may just answer ""properly"" (while answering truthfully/half-truthfully of course) on countless interviews and then they get the diagnosis they want, so they only need doctors for bureaucratic confirmation of things they have already decided they objectively are.   
  
I was in the process of going through these ""confirmation hearings"", while being a pre-almost-everything, but my appearance allowed me to pass a girl in public, when I thought ""The doctors will only hear from me what I have convinced myself in. And this will be the only thing they will tell me back. But it's a real possibility that I might be wrong, that I'm unknowingly fooling myself and them. It might be that I have a case of ""I'd prefer to have been born a girl"" and not a case of ""I'm a girl"". I can't take this risk of subjectivity""   
  
So I guess my question is - is it at all possible to diagnose gender dysphoria/transgenderism objectively, without basing your opinion solely on what the supposedly transgender person tells you?",0
"3370",3410,"&gt; This comprehensive meta-regression analysis reports a significant decline in sperm counts (as measured by SC and TSC) between 1973 and 2011, driven by a 50-60% decline among men unselected by fertility from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Because of the significant public health implications of these results, research on the causes of this continuing decline is urgently needed.

The entire talk is very interesting, but the relevant section starts at 4:53 [according to the transcript](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_asks_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions/transcript?language=en).

Here's the relevant bit of the transcript:

&gt;So I want to show you some cognitive illusions, or decision-making illusions, in the same way. And this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences. It's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein. It basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in donating their organs. [These are different countries in Europe](http://imgur.com/jyraVAp). You basically see two types of countries: countries on the right, that seem to be giving a lot; and countries on the left that seem to giving very little, or much less. The question is, why? Why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little?

&gt;When you ask people this question, they usually think that it has to be about culture. How much do you care about people? Giving organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society, how linked you are. Or maybe it's about religion. But if you look at this plot, you can see that countries that we think about as very similar, actually exhibit very different behavior. For example, Sweden is all the way on the right, and Denmark, which we think is culturally very similar, is all the way on the left. Germany is on the left, and Austria is on the right. The Netherlands is on the left, and Belgium is on the right. And finally, depending on your particular version of European similarity, you can think about the U.K. and France as either similar culturally or not, but it turns out that with organ donation, they are very different.

&gt;By the way, the Netherlands is an interesting story. You see, the Netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group. It turns out that they got to 28 percent after mailing every household in the country a letter, begging people to join this organ donation program. You know the expression, ""Begging only gets you so far."" It's 28 percent in organ donation.

&gt;But whatever the countries on the right are doing, they're doing a much better job than begging. So what are they doing? Turns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV. And here is the story. The countries on the left have a form at the DMV that looks something like this. ""Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program."" And what happens? People don't check, and they don't join. The countries on the right, the ones that give a lot, have a slightly different form. It says, ""Check the box below if you don't want to participate ..."" Interestingly enough, when people get this, they again don't check, but now they join.

1. Chu B. Bill Gates: why do we care more about baldness than malaria? [Internet]. The Independent. 2013. Available from: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bill-gates-why-do-we-care-more-about-baldness-than-malaria-8536988.html

EDIT: I gave the original article a second, closer reading and am now convinced that Gates was only contrasting researching funding for pattern baldness vs research funding for malaria:

&gt; ""The malaria vaccine in humanist terms is the biggest need, but it gets virtually no funding. If you are working on male baldness or other things you get an order of magnitude more research funding because of the voice in the marketplace than something like malaria.""

To those of you who have criticized the comparison between private spending for surgical hair loss treatments to public spending on HIV/AIDS research, I believe your criticisms have merit. That particular comparison appears to have originated with the journalist in question, not with Gates. I should have more carefully composed my original comment. That said, for Gates to criticize the research funding imbalance as he does seems to me to be perfectly valid. He went on to say:

&gt; Mr Gates... said governments should act to offset what he described as this ""flaw in the pure capitalistic approach"".

So Gates wasn't arguing against capitalism; he was arguing for increased public expenditures on research into malaria (and, presumably, other NTDs) to account for the fact that most of the victims of malaria have very little money and so aren't as large of a market for pharmaceutical companies as male pattern baldness sufferers. That seems to me to be an eminently reasonable and defensible position.

If you have a bad pet, you can get rid of it. If your dog is too aggressive with one or more family members, you might get rid of it. Same thing goes for one that is just really destructive or can't be housebroken. Some dogs and cats are escape artists and every chance they get they try to make a break for it. Maybe they come back, maybe they get hit by a car. Some families get a working dog breed only to find out that they don't spend anywhere nearly enough time with the dog for it to get enough exercise.

Siblings on the other hand, children have little to no choice over. They're also much harder to get rid of. Kids don't get to pick their siblings out. Parents might consult their existing children in adoption proceedings, but they're probably not involved too deeply in any conversations surrounding births.

"11254",11410,"Hi Warren, and thank you for doing this AMA.

As I understand it, the premise for deep brain stimulation is that PD is a disease caused by the loss of dopamine producing cells in the brain. This lack of dopamine has second order effects on electrical discharge in cells within the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus internus. The idea is that DBS can help to mitigate the abnormal firing of these cells by sending out electrical pulses.

With this in mind (and please correct me if I am wrong), I have two questions for you:

1. Under what conditions would DBS be preferable to conventional PD therapy: L-DOPA + anti-psychotic (i.e. Nuplazid)? It seems to me that the surgery must carry with it substantial risks (it is brain surgery after all). In trials of DBS, what fraction of patients see a benefit? What is the clinical meaningfulness of this benefit? And how does it weigh against the risks of the surgery and other treatment options?

2. The mechanism of DBS still seems pretty poorly defined. How exactly does constant frequency stimulation affect nearby brain cells?

Thanks!",0

"13918",14121,"**TL;DR;** The Hubble Space Telescope was used to image a galaxy ([3C186](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=3C186)) containing a [quasar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar) located 8 billion light years away from the Earth. In this particular galaxy, the supermassive black hole was [not located at the galactic core](http://i.imgur.com/6Ge1nM6.png). Instead it was 35,000 light-years from the center and traveling outward at an estimated 7.6 million km/h. Researchers believe 3C186 was formed after two galaxies collided and merged 1-2 billion years ago. As the central black holes circled closer and closer together, they began to emit [gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave) that were preferentially oriented in one direction. When the black holes finally merged, the resulting billion-solar-mass black hole launched off in the opposite direction with the energy of 100 million supernovae exploding simultaneously. This study is the first evidence of two supermassive black holes merging.

&gt; **Abstract:** Radio-loud AGNs with powerful relativistic jets are thought to be associated with rapidly spinning black holes (BHs). BH spin-up may result from a number of processes, including accretion of matter onto the BH itself, and catastrophic events such as BH-BH mergers. Aims. We study the intriguing properties of the powerful (L_bol ~ 10^47 erg/s) radio-loud quasar 3C 186. This object shows peculiar features both in the images and in the spectra. Methods. We utilize near-IR Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images to study the properties of the host galaxy, and HST UV and SDSS optical spectra to study the kinematics of the source. Chandra X-ray data are also used to better constrain the physical interpretation. Results. HST imaging shows that the active nucleus is offset by 1.3 +- 0.1 arcsec (i.e. ~11 kpc) with respect to the center of the host galaxy. Spectroscopic data show that the broad emission lines are offset by -2140 +-390 km/s with respect to the narrow lines. Velocity shifts are often seen in QSO spectra, in particular in high-ionization broad emission lines. The host galaxy of the quasar displays a distorted morphology with possible tidal features that are typical of the late stages of a galaxy merger. Conclusions. A number of scenarios can be envisaged to account for the observed features. While the presence of a peculiar outflow cannot be completely ruled out, all of the observed features are consistent with those expected if the QSO is associated with a gravitational wave (GW) recoiling BH. Detailed studies of this object will allow us to confirm such a scenario and will enable a better understanding of both the physics of BH-BH mergers and the phenomena associated with the emission of GW from astrophysical sources.",0

Abstract

&gt; Atomically thin graphene exhibits fascinating mechanical properties, although its hardness and transverse stiffness are inferior to those of diamond. So far, there has been no practical demonstration of the transformation of multilayer graphene into diamond-like ultrahard structures. Here we show that at room temperature and after nano-indentation, two-layer graphene on SiC(0001) exhibits a transverse stiffness and hardness comparable to diamond, is resistant to perforation with a diamond indenter and shows a reversible drop in electrical conductivity upon indentation. Density functional theory calculations suggest that, upon compression, the two-layer graphene film transforms into a diamond-like film, producing both elastic deformations and sp2 to sp3 chemical changes. Experiments and calculations show that this reversible phase change is not observed for a single buffer layer on SiC or graphene films thicker than three to five layers. Indeed, calculations show that whereas in two-layer graphene layer-stacking configuration controls the conformation of the diamond-like film, in a multilayer film it hinders the phase transformation.",0

&gt;""The DSM-V diagnoses individuals with an AUD (Alcohol Use Disorder) if they have experienced a number of the 11 outlined symptoms in the past 12 months:

&gt;Drinking more or for a longer period of time than intended.

&gt;Feeling incapable of cutting back on the amount of alcohol consumed.

&gt;Becoming sick for an extended period of time as a result of drinking too much.

&gt;Inability to concentrate due to alcohol cravings.

&gt;Inability to care for a family, hold down a job, or perform in school.

&gt;Continuing to drink despite problems caused with friends or family.

&gt;Decreased participation in activities which were once important.

&gt;Finding oneself in dangerous or harmful situations as a direct result of drinking.

&gt;Continuing to drink despite adding to another health problem, feeling depressed or anxious or blacking out.

&gt;Drinking more as a result of a tolerance to alcohol.

&gt;Experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

&gt;If you have at least two of these symptoms, this indicates the presence of an alcohol use disorder. Whether you have a mild, moderate, or severe AUD depends on how many of these symptoms you experience.

 

&gt;Mild:�Two�to three symptoms

&gt;Moderate:�Four to five symptoms

&gt;Severe:�Six or more symptoms""

What the hell is that? A wise reasoning scale? IQ is how we measure intelligence. But the scale does not correlate with IQ scores:

&gt;  IQ scores, however, weren't associated one way or another with wise reasoning.

So what did that scale tell us? And why is this post so highly upvoted?

&gt; Participants were asked to remember a recent conflict they had with someone, such as an argument with a spouse or a fight with a friend. They then answered 20 questions applicable to that or any conflict, including: ""Did you ever consider a third-party perspective?"" ""How much did you try to understand the other person's viewpoint?"" and ""Did you consider that you might be wrong?""

So they were pretty much asked ""Are you often wrong and incorrect?"", and poor people answered that they were often wrong and incorrect. That's at least one way you can read these results. How is this even called a wise reasoning scale? It does not describe the scale at all or what it actually measures. If you want to see how they solve problems then let them solve problems while you study them. They are just saying they are solving problems are certain way. They may as well be  blind to the fact that they do not solve problems this way while rich people are not blind to this fact. That's just yet another way to understand the study that goes against the conclusion in the title. The whole ""wise reasoning scale"" thing is not proven here. So the study is based on an unproven foundation.

&gt; One letter, for example, asked about choosing sides in an argument between mutual friends. Each participant then discussed with an interviewer how they thought the situations outlined in the letters would play out. A panel of judges scored their responses according to various measures of wise reasoning.

And they did such a test to prove their claim. But how did they measure the results? ""A panel of judges scored their responses"". So the wise reasoning scale is subjective opinions based on measures of ""*wise reasoning*""?",0

"10031",10173,"Led by scientists at UCLA, an international team of researchers has discovered that bacteria have a ""memory"" that passes sensory knowledge from one generation of cells to the next, all without a central nervous system or any neurons.

""This is a huge surprise to us and to the field,"" said Gerard Wong, a professor of bioengineering and of chemistry and biochemistry, member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA and one of the study's senior authors.

These findings are a major step toward understanding hard-to-treat infections caused by bacterial biofilms in people with cystic fibrosis.

The team studied a strain of bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa that forms biofilms in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis and causes persistent infections that can be lethal. Bacterial biofilms can also form on surgical implants, like an artificial hip; when they do, they can cause the implant to fail. Bacterial biofilms are composed of genetically identical bacteria cells that can colonize nearly any surface and form communities in which single cells organize and cooperate.

""The first step in forming a biofilm is that bacteria must sense the surface and develop the ability to attach,"" said Calvin Lee, a UCLA graduate student, and the study's co-first author. ""For the first time, we were able to follow the behavior of entire lineages of individual cells, and we discovered that the descendants could remember the surface sensing signals of their ancestors.""

&amp;nbsp;

  
**Highlights**  
&amp;nbsp;

* The research shows that consumers react negatively to media reports about tax avoidance strategies.  
* Negative reactions against aggressive tax avoidance are stronger than positive reactions towards responsible tax strategies.  
* Left-leaning consumers are more likely than consumers with right-leaning political views to punish corporations engaging in tax avoidance.  
* All consumers, irrespective of political views, condemn tax avoidance from companies perceived as close to the self.

&amp;nbsp;


**Abstract**

&amp;nbsp;

This study contributes to research on how stakeholders react to corporate tax strategies (CTSs). In two experiments we show that consumers are more likely to react negatively to 'aggressive' rather than to reward 'conservative' CTSs. The impact of CTSs on consumer reactions is mediated by the perceived ethicality of the firm and moderated by individuals' political identification. Right-leaning consumers are less likely than left-leaning consumers to punish companies engaging in tax avoidance. This moderation depends on the personal connection customers have with a particular brand: both left-leaning and right-leaning consumers punish firms they feel close to when such firms engage in aggressive CTSs. The study extends our understanding of the benefits and risks associated with different CTSs. It contributes to debates on the morality of CTSs, showing that political ideology shapes individuals' perceived ethicality of corporations engaged in aggressive tax avoidance.",0

&gt;The results indicate that representations of surroundings exist in the brain that can be used to ""look back"" without the need for turning, perhaps for smooth and efficient movement. In other words, our brain constructs a 360-degree world even though visually we are usually only aware of the area in front of us.

https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/eyes_in_the_back_of_the_head.html

**Abstract**

&gt;Spatial representation surrounding a viewer including outside the visual field is crucial for moving around the three-dimensional world. To obtain such spatial representations, we predict that there is a learning process that integrates visual inputs from different viewpoints covering all the 360� visual angles. 
&gt;We report here the learning effect of the spatial layouts on six displays arranged to surround the viewer, showing shortening of visual search time on surrounding layouts that are repeatedly used (contextual cueing effect). 
&gt;The learning effect is found even in the time to reach the display with the target as well as the time to reach the target within the target display, which indicates that there is an implicit learning effect on spatial configurations of stimulus elements across displays. Since, furthermore, the learning effect is found between layouts and the target presented on displays located even 120� apart, this effect should be based on the representation that covers visual information far outside the visual field.

Toddlers were taken to a room they had never been to before and were given at most 30 minutes to play with the toys. They switched toys more often when there were 16 vs. 4 toys and played with more toys overall. Duration of play will naturally be an inverse of that - and if the kids wanted to check out all the toys first before deciding to which one to use, which you would expect them to do in a new environment, that's naturally going to skew the statistics. The conclusion that they were more distracted by other toys in the 16 toy condition is unsurprising since all the toys were novel. But it would seem rare that toddlers would be given 16 new toys all at once and it's certainly possible that if all the toys were familiar, they might engage for longer and more in-depth types of play with certain toys regardless of how many were present.

Edit: yeesh, it's even worse than I thought - they only looked at 15 minutes of play for each kid because some kids stopped playing after 15 minutes. So that's less than a minute to check out each toy in the 16 toy condition. It's like saying adults at a 4-item buffet savor their food more and switch from one food to another less than adults at a 16-item buffet. ",0

**Abstract:**

&gt; *Married people tend to be healthier than both the previously (bereaved, divorced, and separated) and never married, but the mechanisms through which this occurs remain unclear. To this end, research has increasingly focused on how psychological stress experienced by unmarried versus married individuals may differentially impact physiological systems related to health. One key system that is modulated by stress is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, of which cortisol is a key hormonal product. Increased cortisol production and disruption of cortisol's daily rhythm have been linked to poorer health outcomes. This study examined the association between current marital status and these two indices of cortisol in a community sample of 572 healthy men and women aged 21-55. It also tested whether marriage buffers against the effect of stress (perceived stress by marital status interaction) on cortisol production. Participants provided salivary cortisol samples during waking hours on three nonconsecutive separate days to calculate diurnal cortisol levels and slopes. Married individuals had lower cortisol levels than either their never married or previously married counterparts. Differences in cortisol levels were due at least in part to currently married individuals having a more rapid decline in cortisol through the afternoon hours compared to individuals who were never married (but not those who were previously married). Furthermore, there was an interaction between perceived stress and marital status in predicting cortisol levels. Specifically, higher stress was associated with higher cortisol levels for previously married individuals but not for the married or never married. The results of this study support cortisol as one candidate mechanism accounting for the association of marital status and health.*",0

Abstract: 

A photo-taking-impairment effect has been observed such that participants are less likely to remember objects they photograph than objects they only observe. According to the offloading hypothesis, taking photos allows people to offload organic memory onto the camera's prosthetic memory, which they can rely upon to ""remember"" for them. We tested this hypothesis by manipulating whether participants perceived photo-taking as capable of serving as a form of offloading. In Experiment 1, participants used the ephemeral photo application Snapchat. In Experiment 2, participants manually deleted photos after taking them. In both experiments, participants exhibited a significant photo-taking-impairment effect even though they did not expect to have access to the photos. In fact, the effect was just as large as when participants believed they would have access to the photos. These results suggest that offloading may not be the sole, or even primary, mechanism for the photo-taking-impairment effect.",0

Firstly, you should think of Dark matter as being all the missing bits to our model.  Not just something to make our data fit better like many here claim...If you think a better fit from a model to your data means you're using the best model..then you'll be wrong very often and likely don't do any research anyways.  Ie There's no point in fitting data to a fifth order polynomial to get a slighty better r value when it'd be more reasonable to use a quadratic function.  
  
We all know our standard model is incomplete..and In science we look to compare one observation to another to draw conclusions because it is much easier to run two different experiments and make a comparison than it is to say here is one test i did and these values are right and mean such and such:  ie the data we get from collision experiments in the lab vs data we can get from observing these events in space.  
  
They are looking to gather data from these massive events in space to see what other particles could be missing from our model.  Other scientists get data from particle collisions to find these missing bits (like cern).  If the data they get from space also agrees with the data from tests here, then we now have more ways to test for new particles.

Abstract: 

Individuals expressing belief superiority-the belief that one's views are superior to other viewpoints-perceive themselves as better informed about that topic, but no research has verified whether this perception is justified. The present research examined whether people expressing belief superiority on four political issues demonstrated superior knowledge or superior knowledge-seeking behavior. Despite perceiving themselves as more knowledgeable, knowledge assessments revealed that the belief superior exhibited the greatest gaps between their perceived and actual knowledge. When given the opportunity to pursue additional information in that domain, belief-superior individuals frequently favored agreeable over disagreeable information, but also indicated awareness of this bias. Lastly, experimentally manipulated feedback about one's knowledge had some success in affecting belief superiority and resulting information-seeking behavior. Specifically, when belief superiority is lowered, people attend to information they may have previously regarded as inferior. Implications of unjustified belief superiority and biased information pursuit for political discourse are discussed.",0

With that knowledge in hand, the team designed a one-pot reaction using three of the enzymes to prepare psilocybin from 4-hydroxy-L-tryptophan.  
  
With a little genetic engineering, Thanksgiving dinner may never be the same again.  
  
On a more serious note, this article is really about an opportunity for large-scale synthesis.  Currently, there isn't a market that really justifies this since psilocybin is still Schedule 1 in the USA.  The best application for industrial production of psilocybin is perhaps in the pharma industry where standardization of dose and product is a critical first step towards clinical trials.  Psilocybin is currently being used in a limited study for psychiatric issues such as PTSD, fear of death in terminal patients, and depression.  
  
While this is mostly being considered in only human patients, one must not discount the possible applications towards to meat industry.  For example, a chicken company, such as Purdue, might discover that if you add a little psilocybin to the diet of their chickens, you might be able to pack them a little closer together in the cages.  It's a sick thought but that's how the world works these days.

There's this whole cottage industry of tiny store outlets where they have movie cases or video game racks on the walls, and a little book. They sell Micro SD cards for inflated prices, or you can bring your own SD card and pay about the equivalent of $1-$5 per DVD or videogame to get it copied to the card. These shops also often perform computer repair and console modding services.

Despite some of these countries being extremely well networked and connected, the delays in receiving imported movies, the complications of multi-region DRM, and their relatively exorbitant prices by comparison to local media just makes these kind of networks more attractive.

It also helps that a large portion of Asian countries have cultures where work days are long and late night broadcast schedules sucked, so early on in the broadcast television era, these challenges led to private television recording/copying/rental/exchange shops where you could pay a small fee to receive a recorded copy of your favorite shows to watch on your own schedule.

This leads to a very different attitude in terms of supporting your favorite movies and television, in that Japanese and Korean content creators fully expect to have their licensed media fail to turn a profit, so they attempt to have studios bankroll production costs in exchange for merchandising rights.

Abstract

&gt; Objective To determine the availability of data on overall survival and quality of life benefits of cancer drugs approved in Europe.

&gt; Design Retrospective cohort study.

&gt; Setting Publicly accessible regulatory and scientific reports on cancer approvals by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) from 2009 to 2013.

&gt; Main outcome measures Pivotal and postmarketing trials of cancer drugs according to their design features (randomisation, crossover, blinding), comparators, and endpoints. Availability and magnitude of benefit on overall survival or quality of life determined at time of approval and after market entry. Validated European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) used to assess the clinical value of the reported gains in published studies of cancer drugs.

&gt; Results From 2009 to 2013, the EMA approved the use of 48 cancer drugs for 68 indications. Of these, eight indications (12%) were approved on the basis of a single arm study. At the time of market approval, there was significant prolongation of survival in 24 of the 68 (35%). The magnitude of the benefit on overall survival ranged from 1.0 to 5.8 months (median 2.7 months). At the time of market approval, there was an improvement in quality of life in seven of 68 indications (10%). Out of 44 indications for which there was no evidence of a survival gain at the time of market authorisation, in the subsequent postmarketing period there was evidence for extension of life in three (7%) and reported benefit on quality of life in five (11%). Of the 68 cancer indications with EMA approval, and with a median of 5.4 years' follow-up (minimum 3.3 years, maximum 8.1 years), only 35 (51%) had shown a significant improvement in survival or quality of life, while 33 (49%) remained uncertain. Of 23 indications associated with a survival benefit that could be scored with the ESMO-MCBS tool, the benefit was judged to be clinically meaningful in less than half (11/23, 48%).

&gt; Conclusions This systematic evaluation of oncology approvals by the EMA in 2009-13 shows that most drugs entered the market without evidence of benefit on survival or quality of life. At a minimum of 3.3 years after market entry, there was still no conclusive evidence that these drugs either extended or improved life for most cancer indications. When there were survival gains over existing treatment options or placebo, they were often marginal.",0

Abstract

The locus coeruleus (LC) has established functions in both attention and respiration. Good attentional performance requires optimal levels of tonic LC activity, and must be matched to task consistently. LC neurons are chemosensitive, causing respiratory phrenic nerve firing to increase frequency with higher CO2 levels, and as CO2 level varies with the phase of respiration, tonic LC activity should exhibit fluctuations at respiratory frequency. Top-down modulation of tonic LC activity from brain areas involved in attentional regulation, intended to optimize LC firing to suit task requirements, may have respiratory consequences as well, as increases in LC activity influence phrenic nerve firing. We hypothesize that, due to the physiological and functional overlaps of attentional and respiratory functions of the LC, this small neuromodulatory nucleus is ideally situated to act as a mechanism of synchronization between respiratory and attentional systems, giving rise to a low-amplitude oscillation that enables attentional flexibility, but may also contribute to unintended destabilization of attention. Meditative and pranayama practices result in attentional, emotional, and physiological enhancements that may be partially due to the LC's pivotal role as the nexus in this coupled system. We present original findings of synchronization between respiration and LC activity (via fMRI and pupil dilation) and provide evidence of a relationship between respiratory phase modulation and attentional performance. We also present a mathematical dynamical systems model of respiratory-LC-attentional coupling, review candidate neurophysiological mechanisms of changes in coupling dynamics, and discuss implications for attentional theory, meditation, and pranayama, and possible therapeutic applications.",0

It was not approached with a neutral eye... the professor involved had a clear previous opinion she wanted to prove (I base this on his personal history).

There is two major issues in her methodology that should be questioned.  The first and most obvious- the study was conducted through surveys alone.  Only those who answered all 4 surveys were counted.  Of the original 20,700, only about 1/3 were still part of the final results.   This leaves the obvious problem- a depressed person is far less likely to fill out and return a survey.   With a full 2/3rds of original respondents dropping out, it is safe to say we do NOT have any clear adjustments for this problem.   This study may as easily be said to prove that people who respond to survey style studies consistently over 4 stages are less likely to be depressed.

The second problem with the methodology is more subtle, but very real.  It asks about specific symptoms but leaves out another MAJOR issue with depression diagnosis-  it is often under reported to begin with, especialy among women.  It is already well established that in a survey setting, many people are likely to under report depression symptoms compared to a personal setting.   This has been attributed to societal pressures to be ""happy"", but the reason for it isn't as important as the fact it happens.

Any study that directly contradicts previous studies should always have its methodologies examined.

The higher their starting HbA1c, the greater the effect of the compound, and the higher their BMI the greater the effect. So, essentially, poorly controlled diabetes and obesity made the drug much more effective, and it appears there was basically no significant effect if you didn't have one of those two (although I can't find the numbers for that in the article).

Obviously this will need to be tested more, FDA (in the US) approval, etc., but having a potentially completely safe pill that can be taken once a day along with existing medications would be really nice to have, and 10% reduction is nothing to shrug off.

EDIT - for those questioning how beneficial 10% reduction is, here's a nice quote - ""HbA1c measures blood glucose control in type 1 and type 2 diabetics. For every 1 percent reduction in results of HbA1c blood tests, the risk of developing eye, kidney, and nerve disease is reduced by 40 percent while the risk of heart attack is reduced by 14 percent."" [Source](https://www.hrsa.gov/quality/toolbox/measures/diabetes/)

"3572",3615,"Interesting discussion.  I work in public health and this a quandary we deal with everyday.  The intersection of science and human behavior and religious/moral beliefs a tough one.

As public health professionals do you emphasize abstinence or reduced risk.  Let me give you some examples.

1.  Smoking - it's really terrible for you.  You will, on average die years earlier than non-smokers.  So, do we focus on quitting (abstinence) or reduced risk?  Maybe vaping, maybe smoking fewer....?
2.  Alcohol - do we say you shouldn't drink (abstinence)  or should you drink less, have an Uber in standby, etc.
3.  Do we say don't own a gun (abstinence) or focus on training and licensing?  

The problem with teaching reduced risk is that it is complicated. If you teach people to reduce tobacco use - some will still die of lung cancer.  If you teach reduced risk related to sex, some people will still get an std or pregnant.

So, what do you think?  It's much easier to teach abstinence than reduced risk....don't have sex, don't smoke, don't own a firearm, etc.  but it doesn't work all that well.

Nearly every health or health condition can be broken down this way.  Heart attack victim - no more hamburgers (abstinence) or one a month is ok (reduced risk).  What do people think?",0

As much as my (American) society is becoming cooler about people being gay, it's also much more of a daunting task to come out as gay AND a bottom. From my experience, people do tend to belittle bottoms even in the gay community. Also, during my childhood I didn't quite follow gender norms, and I was definitely bullied for it. However, later in my preteen, teen years and even now, I became obsessed with portraying a sense of masculinity as what seems like a defense mechanism for that bullying. Perhaps unconsciously I was hoping that it would change how I felt about men, but like most people say, sexuality isn't something that one can change. What we can hope for is change in society's outlook towards gay bottoms. I know this study will make some people feel uncomfortable, and that's ok!

Maybe a way to express petty revenge because the first draft sequence of wheat was published in Science journal and not Nature?

The same group is almost ready to publish a much better version sometime this year but have allowed scientists like myself access to the latest sequences for our work.

I actually love these independent efforts because one day, all the data generated will help us get a really polished final version of the genome, ala the human genome sequencing efforts. But no matter how many groups sequence it, the consortium version will most likely be of the highest quality because they are separating each chromosome from the rest and sequencing one at a time. But yeah, the whole 'scooped' thing is utter nonsense.

I must also point out that for what this study claims to be accomplishing, they failed to report sequences for each chromosome separately... unless I failed to see it (I'm on mobile).

**Abstract:**

&gt;Increasing demand for sustainable energy has led to research and development on the cultivation of diverse plant species for biomass production. To support the research and development required to domesticate and cultivate crops for bioenergy, we developed the Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database (BETYdb). BETYdb is a centralized open-access repository that facilitates organization, discovery, and exchange of information about plant traits, crop yields, and ecosystem functions. BETYdb provides user interfaces to simplify storage and discovery as well as programming interfaces that support automated and reproducible scientific workflows. Presently, BETYdb contains over forty thousand observations of plant traits, biomass yields, and ecosystem dynamics collected from the published articles and ongoing field studies. Over half of these records represent fewer than ten genera that have been intensively evaluated for biomass production, while the other half represent over two thousand plant species reflecting research on new crops, unmanaged ecosystems, and land use transitions associated with bioenergy. BETYdb has been accessed over twenty-five thousand times and is used in the fields of bioenergy and ecosystem ecology to quantify yield potential and ecosystem functioning of crops and unmanaged systems under present and future climates. Here, we summarize the database contents and illustrate its applications. We show its utility in a new analysis that confirms that Miscanthus is twice as productive as switchgrass over a much wider range of environmental and management conditions than covered in previous analyses. We compare traits related to carbon uptake and water use of these species with each other and with two coppice shrubs, poplar and willow. These examples, along with a growing body of published research that used BETYdb, illustrate the scope of research supported through this open-access database.",0

The tl;dr explanation of what we did is that we make use of the fact that states enacted laws at different times, which enables us to make a comparison along two dimensions: comparing trends before and after same-sex marriage in the states that did enact such laws (comparing a state to itself before-after the change in laws), and then comparing that difference to the  trends in states that did not enact SSM laws prior to the SCOTUS decision. In this way, we can control for many things that people are mentioning as possible confounders, like the political leanings of a state. Our analysis therefore takes care of anything that is stable in time but differs across states (such as general political views) and also things that are common to all states and changing over time (nation-wide suicide trends or changes in views about LGB people due to mass media that affects the whole country, for example.) Then, we carried out many (many!) robustness and falsification checks (not all can be reported in the published paper, btw) to check on two important things: (1) how robust are our findings to small changes in our assumptions or changes in exactly how we calculate the effect, and (2) whether our method leads us to find other effects that we know do not exist, which would indicate that the method itself is picking up something strange in the data and not a true effect.

"18418",18695,"The full report is a pretty impressive piece of work, resulting from the collaboration of at least 13 federal agencies. There is tons of data in this report. Maybe the easiest place to start is the [Executive Summary](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/executive-summary/), which gives an in depth overview of the report's major findings.

This report is a part of a recurring series of reports, addressing climate. Some significant advances in this report, compared to the last edition, include:

- Advances in scientific understanding and scientific approach, as well as developments in global policy, have occurred since NCA3. A detailed summary of these advances can be found at the end of Chapter 1: Our Globally Changing Climate. Highlights of what aspects are either especially strengthened or are emerging in the current findings include

- Detection and attribution: Significant advances have been made in the attribution of the human influence for individual climate and weather extreme events since NCA3. (Ch. 3, 6, 7, 8).

- Atmospheric circulation and extreme events: The extent to which atmospheric circulation in the midlatitudes is changing or is projected to change, possibly in ways not captured by current climate models, is a new important area of research. (Ch. 5, 6, 7).

- Increased understanding of specific types of extreme events: How climate change may affect specific types of extreme events in the United States is another key area where scientific understanding has advanced. (Chapter 9).

- High-resolution global climate model simulations: As computing resources have grown, multidecadal simulations of global climate models are now being conducted at horizontal resolutions on the order of 15 miles (25 km) that provide more realistic characterization of intense weather systems, including hurricanes. (Chapter 9).

- Oceans and coastal waters: Ocean acidification, warming, and oxygen loss are all increasing, and scientific understanding of the severity of their impacts is growing. Both oxygen loss and acidification may be magnified in some U.S. coastal waters relative to the global average, raising the risk of serious ecological and economic consequences. (Chapters 2, 13).

- Local sea level change projections: For the first time in the NCA process, sea level rise projections incorporate geographic variation based on factors such as local land subsidence, ocean currents, and changes in Earth's gravitational field. (Chapter 12).

- Accelerated ice-sheet loss: New observations from many different sources confirm that ice-sheet loss is accelerating. Combining observations with simultaneous advances in the physical understanding of ice sheets leads to the conclusion that up to 8.5 feet of global sea level rise is possible by 2100 under a higher scenario (RCP8.5), up from 6.6 feet in NCA3. (Chapter 12).

- Low sea-ice areal extent: The annual arctic sea ice extent minimum for 2016 relative to the long-term record was the second lowest on record. The arctic sea ice minimums in 2014 and 2015 were also amongst the lowest on record. Since 1981, the sea ice minimum has decreased by 13.3% per decade, more than 46% over the 35 years. The annual arctic sea ice maximum in March 2017 was the lowest maximum areal extent on record. (Chapter 11).

- Potential surprises: Both large-scale state shifts in the climate system (sometimes called ""tipping points"") and compound extremes have the potential to generate unanticipated climate surprises. The further the Earth system departs from historical climate forcings, and the more the climate changes, the greater the potential for these surprises. (Chapter 15).

- Mitigation: This report discusses some important aspects of climate science that are relevant to long-term temperature goals and different mitigation scenarios, including those implied by government announcements for the Paris Agreement. (Chapters 4, 14).

Potential surprises looks to be an interesting section, in my estimation.",0

"734",743,"There are noticeable planting patterns in almost every city in the country.  You can see trees of the same species, similar age, and condition all around different parts of town.  Knowing the trees around here, I can tell which areas or town were built in which decade by the street trees, or combinations of plantings around structures.  

Being in the Midwest, certain trees flourish in a parkway setting, and can take years of abuse from roads, poor pruning, power lines, lightning strikes etc. but nothing really accounts for greater losses of these trees than exotic pests.  Whether it was the Elm Trees of the 60's and 70's The American Chestnut, and now the Ash, signs of improper planting and culture habits are evident in these recent disasters.  Iconic tree species nearly wiped out (especially so with the chestnut) and entire avenues left bare due to mono cultural plantings.

Many cities are taking note and using contractors to carefully select species based on a number of factors to choose the best possible trees for that area.  This is quite labor intensive and therefor expensive, but can greatly broaden the diversity throughout urban settings, parks etc.  

The last few years have been really rough on spruce trees here in Northern Illinois, and I'm seeing a couple diseases really do some damage to these stressed trees.  

Hopefully cities will wake up to the idea that spending a little more off the bat with better tree selections and avoiding monocultures can save them in the long run of having to clear cut entire blocks all over town when the next pandemic rolls through...

I won't go into quite as much detail here as I did there, but based on some research I've done into the visual cortex as part of my AI research, I'd say that the reason behind this is that your brain prioritizes presenting visual information to your consciousness at as high a rate as possible at the expense of longer running input analysis in order to reduce the inherent latency in out visual system. Normally our visual processing is very synchronous across the visual cortex and this mechanism changes to a more asynchronous processing that ends up causing some information to be lost. This process would also explain people's tendency to not be able to remember an attackers face during a traumatic event but still be able to remember their words and voice as the audio cortex has no functional need need for such a mechanism.

It would make sense that responding faster to a threat is more advantageous than being able to properly analyze or remember facial information. 

Since anxiety also triggers many of the same mechanisms as the regular fight or flight response, it would make sense that it ends up trigging the same prioritization method.

"4104",4154,"This seems like some very irresponsible science journalism to me. The author is suggesting that AD may be transmissible by blood, and that you may be able to catch it via blood transfusion.

As far as I can tell, the authors of the original research do not believe this. No one quoted in the New Scientist piece believes it. Yet they ran with a headline and lede that is totally contrary to the opinions of everyone quoted in their article.

Can Abeta act like a prion? Sure, this has been known for quite some time. Many mouse models of AD leverage this property, and work by inject amyloid into healthy mice. So this aspect of the research isn't really new.

Rather the researchers were asking a more nuanced question. Since Abeta can be produced in multiple places in the  body, is it only brain Abeta that contributes to disease, or can peripheral Abeta also drive AD?

To test this, they took a mouse model of AD where amyloid is made both in the brain and the periphery and stitched these mice to wild type mice so that their circulatory systems were connected. This allowed amyloid from the blood of the AD mouse to perfuse into the blood of the wild type mouse. After 12 months, the researchers found that the wild type mice had begun to exhibit some signs of AD.

Does this mean blood transfusion can cause AD? Far from it. There is a huge leap between a transfusion and being linked to a mouse thast overproduces amyloid for 12 months.

Does it mean that targeting Abeta in the periphery is important for a therapy to work? Potentially. An this is important, because many of the antibody drugs being developed against abeta do not do a great job crossing the blood brain barrier. If they could work in the periphery, that would give them a shot to engage their target in a biologically relevant manner. It's worth noting, though, that Abeta targeting antibodies have yet to slow disease progression in any Phase III trial.",0

Imagine sitting at home and a full squadron of armor clad officers knock on the door with a warrant. The lead detective tells you that have reason to believe you've done X.

**Abstract**
Caloric restriction (CR) without malnutrition extends lifespan and delays the onset of age-related disorders in most species but its impact in nonhuman primates has been controversial. In the late 1980s two parallel studies were initiated to determine the effect of CR in rhesus monkeys. The University of Wisconsin study reported a significant positive impact of CR on survival, but the National Institute on Aging study detected no significant survival effect. Here we present a direct comparison of longitudinal data from both studies including survival, bodyweight, food intake, fasting glucose levels and age-related morbidity. We describe differences in study design that could contribute to differences in outcomes, and we report species specificity in the impact of CR in terms of optimal onset and diet. Taken together these data confirm that health benefits of CR are conserved in monkeys and suggest that CR mechanisms are likely translatable to human health.
